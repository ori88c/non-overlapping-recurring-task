  "version": "1.1.1",
  "description": "A modern `setInterval` substitute tailored for asynchronous tasks, ensuring non-overlapping executions by skipping attempts if a previous execution is still in progress. Features execution status getters, graceful teardown, and a fixed delay between runs. The ability to gracefully await the completion of an ongoing execution makes it ideal for production apps demanding smooth resource cleanup.",
